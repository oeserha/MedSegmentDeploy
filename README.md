### Project Overview

This project aims to explore the following capabilities in an MLOps platform:
* using terraform to create infrastructure
* exploring large models (using PyTorch, and some foundational models)
* creating a model selection pipeline for above models
* exploring experiment tracking services, both within AWS and third party options

### List of Tutorials
To aid in this project, several new softwares were explored. While learning about these, I discovered several tutorials that I found to be helpful. The tutorials I used are listed below:

* [terraform](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5_Rrj9tYQAlgX9bTzlTN0WzU67ZeoSi_): basics of how to set up a terraform project
* [AWS Experiments](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-sagemaker-experiments-organize-track-and-compare-your-machine-learning-trainings/): Reviews how to use AWS Sagemaker experiments using the MNIST dataset
* [Weights & Biases on AWS](https://wandb.ai/wandb/sm-pytorch-mnist-new/reports/Using-AWS-Sagemaker-and-Weights-Biases-Together-on-Digit-Recognition-with-MNIST---Vmlldzo4MTk3Nzg): Reviews how to use weights and biases on AWS using the MNIST dataset
